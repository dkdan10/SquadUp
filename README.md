# SquadUp

Visit the live site

SquadUp is a single-page, full-stack web application modeled after MeetUp. SquadUp allows for users to create groups and events the serve to connect people in real life acoording to their common intrests. The clone was made with Ruby on Rails, PostgresSQL, React.js and Redux. Live messaging was incorporated with Application Cables, Rails built in Websockets. 

## Why MeetUp?

Meetup has a place close to my heart because when I was growing up I moved countries every two years. I would use Meetup to quickly find communities of people that share my intrests. Meetup's mission of getting people to meet in the real world is something special to me.
